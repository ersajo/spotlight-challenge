# GrainChain Tech Interview

## First Steps
First of all, we need to run the following command to install the dependencies for the project.
```
npm install
```

With this command we will install the dependencies for both projects. We need to run interface and backend at the same time in different terminals to be able to run the whole project appropriately.

`Run interface`
In a terminal we need to run 
```
npm run start
```
to launch the GUI in order to be able to see the results and send a new request to validate a new scenario.

`Run backend`
In other terminal without finish the process from the `Run interface` step we need to run the following command.
```
npm run backend
```
